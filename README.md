# JinalWorkSpace
Projects included for Twitter API usages.

This project performs search of given input string and prints all associated top 10 hashtags. This project will let user
to choose input string and everytime top hashtags are printed for given string. User has also an option to exit out of the program.
User will be prompted for the input and will have option to exit the program. It prompts after every 30 seconds for the new string
where it will print all top 10 hashtags if any. 

We can also have similar solution in another way by adding listener class where it can keep listening all the status and provides all the
information. We can use the text we receive from there and parse for hashtags. However, due to time constraint I have just 
performed the first solution and can work for this second way as well if it is permitted.

Key's are not the actual one so please use your own key.
